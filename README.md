# federated-learning

Scripts and testing done for Federated Learning research with Professor Stamp at SJSU
- "In this project, we experimentally analyze the susceptibility of selected Federated Learning (FL) systems to the presence of adversarial clients.
  We find that temporal attacks significantly affect model performance in FL, especially when the adversaries are active throughout and during the ending
  rounds of the FL process. Machine Learning models like Multinominal Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Neural Network models like
  Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and tree-based machine
  learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost were considered. These results highlight the effectiveness of temporal attacks and the need to develop
  strategies to make the FL process more robust. We also explore defense mechanisms, including outlier detection in the aggregation algorithm."
  
  - Did research testing **SVC model's** performance as a function of # of adversarial clients and percentage of labels flipped
  - 10 client and 100 client trials [documented](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJeHU0Ka1GPAkKAYLv_XzsnQmEBQXAPCHbja6XhR2Ac/edit?usp=sharing)
